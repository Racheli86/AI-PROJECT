# Final Project
# Protein-Metal Binding Analysis

This project utilizes machine learning to analyze protein structures and predict metal ion (Magnesium/Manganese) binding preferences. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using Random Forest and SVM algorithms.

**Key Features:**

* Data processing from Protein Data Bank (PDB) files.
* Feature extraction and engineering.
* Classification model for Mg/Mn binding.

For more details, please refer to the documentation or the project's presentation.
